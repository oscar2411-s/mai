## mai
Mai is a simple Discord bot, which can generate images based on your desires. 
Mai is built using the [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) (Java Discord API), which means she is generally very fast.


### Commands:
- Flag command: returns an image of your desired flag
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/C5du7iO.png"  alt ="flag" />
- Hello command: greets you
- String to image command: generates an image of an input string

### Future commands:
- Curve command: able to draw curves
- Probability tree command: able to draw probability trees
